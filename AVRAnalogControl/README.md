This is a very simple program that was intitially coded for the Atmega328p MCU that was programmmed using the ICSP interface of an Arduino clone board using the AVRISP programmer. 
The program was designed to read analog inputs coming from two analog sticks-- one of which controlled two stepper motor
drivers on separate pins, while the other controlled a single driver on a single pin. 
The specific driver used was the polulu 8-35v, 2A Single Bi-polar Stepper Motor Driver with an A4988 IC.
