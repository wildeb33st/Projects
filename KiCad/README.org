* Design Specification
Below are the specifications for the design:
- The Device is powered over USB and as such the overall power requirement is *2.5W* with an current of *500mA* and a voltage of *5V*
- The device will be single channel operating within the general audio frequency range i.e. /20Hz to 20kHz/
- Signal Analysis and Signal Generation will be performed by the device
- The use of a DAC/ADC is required along with an MCU. The bit depth chosen for the design is 12.
- The MCU family is the STM32
- SWD is chosen for debugging purposes
